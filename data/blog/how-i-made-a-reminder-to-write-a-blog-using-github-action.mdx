As a writer, I understand the importance of consistency when it comes to publishing new content. However, there are times when life gets in the way, and it can be challenging to remember to write a new blog post. To help me stay on track with my sharing schedule, I created a simple reminder using GitHub Actions. In this post, I will share how I made this workflow.

## What is GitHub Action?

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate your workflows. You can use it to build, test, and deploy your code. You can also use it to perform a wide range of other tasks, such as sending notifications or scheduling reminders.

## How I Created a Reminder to Write a Blog Post

To create a reminder to write a blog post, I'm using [GitHub special repository of README.md](https://github.com/ImBIOS/ImBIOS) and added a file named .github/workflows/blog-posts.yml. In this file, I defined the workflow that GitHub Actions would execute. Here's the initial content of the file:

```yml
name: Blog Posts

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Run at 00:00 every Sunday
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-posts:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Update post list
        run: |
          sleep 1m
          curl -LO https://blog.imam.dev/feed.xml
          node src/list-posts.js
          rm feed.xml
      - name: Commit changes
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git add -A
          git diff-index --quiet HEAD || git commit -m "Update blog posts"
      - name: Pull changes
        run: git pull -r
      - name: Push changes
        uses: ad-m/github-push-action@0fafdd62b84042d49ec0cb92d9cac7f7ce4ec79e
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This workflow is triggered every Sunday at 00:00. It then runs a script that updates the list of blog posts. The script is written in JavaScript and parses the RSS feed of my blog. It then generates a list of blog posts and updates the README.md file. Finally, it commits the changes and pushes them to GitHub. I'm using ouuan's repository as a reference for this workflow.

Where is the reminder came from? It's actually in the list-posts.js file. I added a reminder to the list of blog posts. Here's the content of the file:

```js
const { readFileSync, writeFileSync } = require('fs')

/**
 * Convert XML string to JSON
 * @param {string} xmlString
 * @returns {object} json
 */
const xmlToJson = (xmlString) => {
  const regex = /<(\w+)([^>]*)>([\s\S]*?)<\/\1>/gm
  const matches = xmlString.matchAll(regex)
  const json = {}

  for (const match of matches) {
    const [, key, attributes, value] = match
    const subMatches = value.matchAll(regex)
    const subJson = {}

    for (const subMatch of subMatches) {
      const [, subKey, subAttributes, subValue] = subMatch

      if (subValue.match(regex)) {
        if (Array.isArray(subJson[subKey])) {
          subJson[subKey].push(
            xmlToJson(`<${subKey}${subAttributes}>${subValue}</${subKey}>`)[subKey]
          )
        } else if (subJson[subKey]) {
          subJson[subKey] = [
            subJson[subKey],
            xmlToJson(`<${subKey}${subAttributes}>${subValue}</${subKey}>`)[subKey],
          ]
        } else {
          subJson[subKey] = xmlToJson(`<${subKey}${subAttributes}>${subValue}</${subKey}>`)[subKey]
        }
      } else if (Array.isArray(subJson[subKey])) {
        subJson[subKey].push(subValue)
      } else if (subJson[subKey]) {
        subJson[subKey] = [subJson[subKey], subValue]
      } else {
        subJson[subKey] = subValue
      }
    }

    if (json[key]) {
      if (Array.isArray(json[key])) {
        json[key].push(subJson)
      } else {
        json[key] = [json[key], subJson]
      }
    } else {
      json[key] = subJson
    }
  }

  return json
}

/**
 * Sort JSON by pubDate
 * @param {object} json
 * @returns {object} sortedJson
 */
const sortJson = (json) => {
  json.sort((a, b) => new Date(b.pubDate) - new Date(a.pubDate))
  return json
}

// Read XML file and convert to JSON
const xmlString = readFileSync('feed.xml', 'utf8')
const feeds = sortJson(xmlToJson(xmlString).rss.channel.item)

// Create Markdown list of posts
const posts = feeds
  .slice(0, 5)
  .map(
    (item) =>
      `- ${new Date(item.pubDate).toISOString().split('T')[0]} [${item.title}](${
        item.link
      }?utm_source=GitHubProfile)`
  )

// Update README.md if posts have changed,
// Otherwise throw an error to remind me to write a blog post
const readme = readFileSync('README.md', 'utf8')
if (readme.includes(posts.join('\n'))) {
  throw new Error('No new blog posts')
} else {
  const updatedReadme = readFileSync('README.md', 'utf8').replace(
    /(?<=<!--START_SECTION:blog-posts-->\n)[\s\S]*(?=\n<!--END_SECTION:blog-posts-->)/,
    posts.join('\n')
  )
  writeFileSync('README.md', updatedReadme)

  console.log('Updated README.md')
}
```

The script reads the RSS feed of my blog and generates a list of blog posts. It then updates the README.md file with the list of blog posts. If there are no new blog posts, it throws an error to remind me to write a blog post.

It's just an error that will be thrown when the script is executed while the posts are still the same and it's not a reminder that will be sent to my email or something more visible to me. So, I decided to enable the notification for any failed workflow runs. Here's how to do it:

1. Click on the top right corner of the page and select **Settings**.
2. Select **Notifications** on the left sidebar.
3. Click on **Actions**.
4. Select **Send notifications for failed workflows only**.

Now, I will get a notification when the script is executed and there are no new blog posts. I can also see the notification on the GitHub website.

## Another Way That I Explored

The previous workflow that I tell you about is a modified version so my README.md is always up to date. I also explored another way to create a reminder to write a blog post. But, it's a pure reminder without any README.md update mechanism, just a reminder.

To create a reminder to write a blog post, I created a new GitHub repository and added a file named `.github/workflows/remind.yml`. In this file, I defined the workflow that GitHub Actions would execute. Here's the content of the file:

```yml
name: Reminder to write a blog post

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 10 * * 1-5'

jobs:
  remind:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Send a reminder
        uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3.1.0
        with:
          server_address: smtp.gmail.com
          server_port: 465
          username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
          subject: 'Reminder to write a new blog post'
          body: "Don't forget to write a new blog post today!"
          to: my-email@example.com
```

This workflow sends me an email reminder every weekday at 10:00 AM, reminding me to write a new blog post. I used a third-party action, dawidd6/action-send-mail, to send the email. I provided my email credentials as GitHub secrets, so they are not visible in the workflow file.

## Conclusion

I have explored two ways to create a reminder to write a blog post. The first way is to update the README.md file of my GitHub profile. The second way is to send an email reminder. I'm currently using the first way because it's more visible than the second way. I can see the reminder every time I visit my GitHub profile.

Creating a reminder to write a blog post using GitHub Actions is a simple and effective way to stay on track with your blogging schedule. With this workflow in place, you'll never forget to write a new post again.
