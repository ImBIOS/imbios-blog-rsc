summary: Welcome to my blog

I have been thinking with the idea of starting up a new blog for quite a while but school has kept me occupied and the plans were constantly pushed back. Last year, I explored the possibility of using a wordpress system but it just seems too much of a trouble to incorporate all the features I wanted. The recently introduced Next.js 12 makes me hyped to make a blog.

With school winding down, I began to explore ways to document and share my thoughts. I guess reaching the end of my formal education pathway made me aware of how easy it is to just go on with the flow of life, stop questioning, stop thinking. So here's my attempt to fight against that inertia, to stay critically engaged and curious. Anyway, I have always enjoyed discussing nitty grity details on empirical research and this blog seems like a natural extension to it.

I hope to use this platform to document most of my research projects and experiments coding in Typescript, Javascript, and several other languages. The ever increasing number of user-written Javascript projects makes it such a flexible platform to conduct analysis and publish results. Content wise here are some stuff I plan to write about:

- Frontend Web Engineering
- Machine Learning
- Cybersecurity
- Other random things

Ok, the last category intentionally keeps my options fairly open but we shall see how it evolves down the road. In the meantime please excuse the messiness and constant changes. I am still playing around with some features but let me know if you have any thoughts on the content or what you would like to see. Meanwhile...

```javascript
console.log('Hello World')
```
