## Why Deploy Next.js with Bun and Docker?

When Bun hit its stable version 1 and Vercel started supporting it as a package manager (though still relying on Node for runtime), I was intrigued. How could you simulate the Vercel deployment process locally? Specifically, how can you deploy a Next.js standalone app with Bun and Docker? This guide aims to answer these questions.

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Docker, Next.js, and Bun
- Node.js installed
- Bun package manager installed

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Dockerfile

Here's the full `dockerfile` you'll need.

```dockerfile
FROM imbios/bun-node:18-slim AS deps
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# I use Asia/Jakarta as my timezone, you can change it to your timezone
RUN apt-get -y update && \
  apt-get install -yq openssl git ca-certificates tzdata && \
  ln -fs /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Jakarta /etc/localtime && \
  dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive tzdata
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile

# Build the app
FROM deps AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

RUN bun run build


# Production image, copy all the files and run next
FROM node:18-slim AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ARG CONFIG_FILE
COPY $CONFIG_FILE /app/.env
ENV NODE_ENV production
# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during runtime.
# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

COPY --from=builder  /app/.next/standalone ./

EXPOSE 3001

ENV PORT 3001

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### Step 2: Custom Shell Script

Create a custom shell script ./build.sh.

```build.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Run Next.js build with passed arguments
next build "$@"

# Copy files only if not in a CI environment
if [ -z "$CI" ]; then
  cp -r ./public ./.next/standalone/public
  cp -r ./.next/static ./.next/standalone/.next/static
fi
```

## Common Errors and Troubleshooting

I ran into some issues during my first attempt, especially errors prefixed with node:. I fixed them by using `imbios/bun-node` instad of `oven/bun` as the base image. Becase we need Node.js fallback for Bun's not yet implemented features.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you should have a Next.js app deployed, mimicking the Vercel deployment process, with Bun and Docker. Feel free to tweak and optimize the setup according to your project's needs.
