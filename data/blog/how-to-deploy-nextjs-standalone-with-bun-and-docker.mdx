## Backstory

When I hear the news about Bun released its stable version 1 and Vercel officially supported Bun as package manager (not runtime yet, still using node).
I wonder, how to mimic the Vercel deployment process locally? Or to be precise, how to deploy Next.js as standalone with Bun and Docker?

## First Attempt

I setup a new `dockerfile` to mimic the Vercel deployment process using `oven/bun:slim`, but it failed. I got some error I forgot what it was.
But it has prefix `node:`, so I expect it as bun's not yet implemented node features.

## The Final Attempt

Here's full `dockerfile` I use to deploy Next.js standalone with Bun and Docker.

```dockerfile
FROM imbios/bun-node:18-slim AS deps
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# I use Asia/Jakarta as my timezone, you can change it to your timezone
RUN apt-get -y update && \
  apt-get install -yq openssl git ca-certificates tzdata && \
  ln -fs /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Jakarta /etc/localtime && \
  dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive tzdata
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
COPY package.json bun.lockb ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile

# Build the app
FROM deps AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

RUN bun run build


# Production image, copy all the files and run next
FROM node:18-slim AS runner
WORKDIR /app

ARG CONFIG_FILE
COPY $CONFIG_FILE /app/.env
ENV NODE_ENV production
# Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during runtime.
# ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

COPY --from=builder  /app/.next/standalone ./

EXPOSE 3001

ENV PORT 3001

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Because I just want to try it locally, I changed the behaviour of `bun run build` to run custom shell script `./build.sh`:

```build.sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Run Next.js build with passed arguments
next build "$@"

# Copy files only if not in a CI environment
if [ -z "$CI" ]; then
  cp -r ./public ./.next/standalone/public
  cp -r ./.next/static ./.next/standalone/.next/static
fi
```

## New Docker image

I also create a new Docker image based on `oven/bun` with `node` installed. You can check it out [in the docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/imbios/bun-node).
Or in the [Github repository](https://github.com/ImBIOS/bun-node).
